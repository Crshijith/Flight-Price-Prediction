# Flight Price Prediction

This is a machine learning project based on different machine learning algorithms used to find the price of a flight ticket. The dataset is from Kaggle. Several machine learning algorithms are used in this project, different models have been compared and based on the study of the results from different models final model selection has been done. The purpose of using several models is to get a wider range of choices in results through which the decision becomes easier.
